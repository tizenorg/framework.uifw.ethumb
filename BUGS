Possible error when calculating edje frame size for thumbnails.

Since edje_object_size_min_calc() still doesn't retuns the actual edje object
size, it's possible that a part from the edje frame stay outside the picture.
This should be fixed soon, with a new call to get the current edje object size
or changing something on the API to tell ethumb that the frame has some border.
